JavaScript Arrays Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice writing arrays
2. Practice manipulating arrays
3. Explain how to manipulate arrays in a non-destructive way

## Introduction

Previously, we've learned about how arrays work. We know that `push()` pushes
elements onto the ends of arrays, and `pop()` pops them off; similarly,
`unshift()` adds elements to the beginnings of arrays, and `shift()` pulls them
off.

Now it's time to put what we've learned to the test.
